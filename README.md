# Typescript Plop React Template

This is some boilerplate code I'm setting up for my projects. It includes a few different libraries that I find myself adding to my projects often.

- Typescript: Adds types to JavaScript which helps with bug fixes
- Router: For rendering web pages
- Plop: Allows you to generate custom code templates for more consistent code
- Redux: For global state management
- Material-UI: For styling that's easier to maintain
- Absolute Imports: Makes everything more neat and much easier to move around Components if needed.
